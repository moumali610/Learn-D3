					<h2>Correlations Discovered Between Diabetes and Low-income Population</h2>
					<p>In this diagram there is a representation of two variables: Diabetes and Poverty. After collection of our data, we have determined that there is a positive correlation between people in poverty and Diabetes. As poverty goes up the percentage of people with Diabetes increases as well. There may be many underlying factors that can lead to these results such as the lack of resources in order to maintain a healthy life. Also, the lack of proper healthcare does not allow the individual to seek care which can ultimately lead to serious health problems and in this case the risk of diabetes.
